# Web Design Challenge
Northwestern University Data Science Boot Camp

[Homework 11](https://nu.bootcampcontent.com/NU-Coding-Bootcamp/nu-chi-data-pt-08-2020-u-c/tree/master/02-Homework/11-Web/Instructions)

In this project, I built a multi-page, responsive, and sleek website to display weather pre-analyzed weather data. The structure of the website contains the following:
- landing page:
  - links to each visualization
  - sidebar with preview images of each plot
- visualization pages (4):
  - close up view of the chosen plot
  - brief written analysis
- comparison page:
  - visual comparisons of each visualization
- data page:
  - table containing raw data used for the analysis
  
In order to accomplish these goals I used the following:
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap to obtain develop responsive and visually pleasing web pages
- Python to convert a CSV into an HTML table
